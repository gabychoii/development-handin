                    The goal of this assigment was to create a simple, functional aggregator interface using React. More specifically, we
                    were given creative liberty in design to encourage the practice of competitive analysis amongst various existing 
                    aggregator interfaces of choice.

                    On first impression, this seemed like a challenging assigment on two fronts. First, critical analysis of websites through the 
                    perspective of strong design principles, rather than an everyday user. Secondly, it was evident that this project required
                    a higher level of planning and organization than prior projects, with a heavier focus on component relationships.

            <div class="card-title">Comparative Analysis of Website Features</div>
            Through conducting an analysis of these three sites, I concluded that although they all share the very basic concept of 
            favoriting or saving an item, each has slight but impactful differences that affect a user’s interaction with the favorite function. 
            All sites presented their list items in the form of cards with a variation of information beneath the card. However, this is where they started to differ 
            - regarding the user action of favoriting the item itself, Pinterest requires a user to hover over the card, whereas Depop and NYT have the “favorite”  
            button directly on the card itself. Next, after an item is favorited, all three sites change the color of the favorite button (principle of contrast) 
            to indicate a successful save, but only Pinterest has a direct notification. NYT and Depop’s favoriting-related design factors  are likely more successful 
            than Pinterest, because these sites both display cards in rows, with a descriptor of each row above (satisfying Gestalt’s principle of proximity). On the other hand, 
            Pinterest displays its cards to fill in open spaces vertically - due to the fact that the card size adjusts to the size of the image, this results in a column-oriented 
            layout (going against the “Z scan pattern”). Lastly, between NYT and Depop, it appears that NYT may be more successful, as it uses category tags, various fonts, and color 
            coding to differentiate various item categories.

            This competitive analysis excersize helped make the overall task less daunting - it helped me understand that "good design" can be broken into a combination of
            simpler components that can be recreated more easily. Splitting the overarching task into smaller goals was effective in helping me analyze and understand the various
            design choices made by each company.

                The above design choices were patterns shared amongst these three websites that stood out to me because they contributed to the
                clean, but functional appearance and usage of each website. These are elements I aimed to include in my own design.

                Pick a theme that can make use of lists AND an aggregator. For whichever theme you pick,

                When brainstorming themes that would fit the above criteria, I took the approach of thinking of lists that are useful
                to me, and came up with the idea of a Movie Watchlist theme. Watching movies is one of my biggest hobbies, and I feel that
                I always have a large list of movies that I want to watch, and often forget as it isn't written down anywhere.

            <div id="text-general">
                <div class="card-title">Meeting the Criteria</div>
                The list requirement is satisfied through the list of movies displayed in cards. The movies are aggregated with the "Add to watchlist +" 
                button to a separate watchlist. They can be filtered by theme and language, and sorted by release year (ascending or descending). The watchlist 
                can additionally be reset. Given the assignment requirements and the inspiration I drew from the competitive analysis exercise, I hand-sketched 
                the following prototype:

                Overall, I found this project to be very rewarding and not as intimidating as I had originally imagined. I feel that I was able to get a better grasp
                of the front-end design concepts I learned in 32, and use past projects from 32 and this class to create a functional aggregator interface. Personally, this further
                reafirmed my preference for front-end design and analysis as opposed to back-end, and taught me to think of front-end from a more technical standpoint technical
                before.
